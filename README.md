# Heat transfer in an electric car’s battery pack modeled in Q-Bat
[![View Battery pack Simulink model with Q-Bat and Simscape on File Exchange](https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/images/matlab-file-exchange.svg)](https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/)

This repository shows how to model heat transfer in an electric car’s battery pack in Q-Bat from QuickerSim. The model consists 96 lithium prismatic cells (96s1p), terminals, connectors, holders, casing and cooling plates and is connected to a reduced-order model (ROM) to model heat transfer in 3D geometry.
