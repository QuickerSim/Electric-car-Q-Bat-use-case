This repository shows how to model heat transfer in an electric car’s battery pack in Q-Bat from QuickerSim. The model consists 96 lithium prismatic cells (96s1p), terminals, connectors, holders, casing and cooling plates and is connected to a reduced-order model (ROM) to model heat transfer in 3D geometry.
